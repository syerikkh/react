            <p1>I'm a passionate, self-proclaimed designer who specializes in full stack<br /> development (React.js & Node.js). I am very enthusiastic about bringing the <br />technical and visual aspects of digital products to life. User experience, pixel<br /> perfect design, and writing clear, readable, highly performant code matters <br />to me.</p1>
            <p1>I began my journey as a web developer in 2015, and since then, I've <br />continued to grow and evolve as a developer, taking on new challenges and <br />learning the latest technologies along the way. Now, in my early thirties, 7<br /> years after starting my web development journey, I'm building cutting-edge<br /> web applications using modern technologies such as Next.js, TypeScript,<br /> Nestjs, Tailwindcss, Supabase and much more.</p1>
            <p1>I am very much a progressive thinker and enjoy working on products end to <br />end, from ideation all the way to development.</p1>
            <p1>When I'm not in full-on developer mode, you can find me hovering around on<br /> twitter or on indie hacker, witnessing the journey of early startups or<br /> enjoying some free time. You can follow me on Twitter where I share tech-<br />related bites and build in public, or you can follow me on GitHub.</p1>
            <p1>Finally, some quick bits about me.</p1>
